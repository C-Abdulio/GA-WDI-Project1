    - Rev may or may not be affected by gravity (TBD).
- players must guide Rev through an obstacle course in space, avoiding asteroids and space debree.
  - obstacles are collidible objects that scroll forward toward the player.
    - There is only one way to lose: if Rev bumps with an object. Then the game ends and you can choose to try again.
