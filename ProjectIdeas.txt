Project 1: Game Ideas for Proposal

1)Saturday Morning Breakfast Warrior
- A Single-Player "Zelda-like" action-adventure game in 3 acts.
  - player controls The Breakfast Warrior, who can move in all 4 directions through the direction arrows.
  - The Breakfast Warrior attacks using a giant spoon. The Spoon is also a key event tied to a button.
  - players guide the BW through 3 inter-connected maps, filled with obstacles and enemies.
    - first map is simple. Go through a maze of rocks to go to the other side and enter map2.
    - second map has enemies. All enemies have to be defeated in order to open door to map3.
      - enemies has 2 hit points. Player must attack enemies twice with their Spoon to defeat them.
        - enemies may also be moving in pre-set pattern.
      - player also has 2 hit points. Enemies may hurt the player by colliding with them or attacking them (TBD).
        - if player loses both hit points, they lose the game. Game resets back to map1.
    - third map has one item to collect, the Holy Cereal. There may or may not be enemies or a boss.
      -once player has collected the item, they win the game.
      - player is prompted to play again. on click, game resets to map1.

2)RevRad Space Course
- A Single Player "FlappyBird-Like" perpetually scrolling action game.
- You are Rev Rock-It, an android with a rocket engine on his head. His hair becomes the exhaust flames.
- players can move Rev in only 2 directions: up and down. This is controlled by 2 keys (either up or down arrows or other buttons).
    - Rev may or may not be affected by gravity (TBD).
- players must guide Rev through an obstacle course in space, avoiding asteroids and space debree.
  - obstacles are collidible objects that scroll forward toward the player.
    - There is only one way to lose: if Rev bumps with an object. Then the game ends and you can choose to try again.
- There is no real win condition, but there is a score counter that increases the longer you guide Rev unharmed.
  - you can store up to 3 high scores with 3 letter initials.

3)StudentSnooze
- a Single-Player puzzle game/mini-game that could expand to multiplayer.
- a session last about 1 minute.
- player controls a student with poor sleeping habits. He is constantly falling asleep.
- He is sleeping during the middle of a lecture review for an important test.
 (_Ok, to be honest, this is mostly an idea I just came up with a few minutes ago.
 I am still trying to determine the core goal of the game.)
 EDIT: I thought about it and the most engaging goal would be about keeping the student awake during the class.
 - The student will steadedly get more and more drowsy. This is represented not just through the player sprite,
 but through a giant bar on the left.
 - The bar will decrease over time. If the bar empties, the student will fall asleep.
 - The player's goal is to keep the student awake through 2 methods
  - One method of waking the student up is through an event (either a key press or a click).
    - When used, the sleep bar will increase by a set increment, staving off sleep for a bit longer.
    - However, there is only a limited amount of these actions available. For the sake of example, the limit is 4.
      - Every time the player uses an action, the amount of of the bar regained is lessened. The last action should wake the student for only a few seconds.
  - Another method will be using limited use items, such as coffee, energy drinks, candy or
    - These items are represented by icons on the bottom. These are onClick events that will increase the bar by a set amount.
      - To keep things fair, the amount of items you get should be randomized. Perhaps through an array.
  - The win condition is determined by a letter grade.
  - This letter grade is determined by how long the player is able to stay awake in class.
    - If the student falls asleep early, they may be penalized by earning a D or below.
      - if student gets a D or below, you lose.
    - If the student stays awake for the majority of class, he may get a C or above.
      -At this point, the player will be prompted to play again
    - You win the game completely if you get an A.
